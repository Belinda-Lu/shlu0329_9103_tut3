## Part 1
Our group selected Broadway Boogie Woogie by Piet Mondrian as our inspiration. Its grid-based composition immediately reminded us of arcade games from the 1980s and 1990s, such as Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. The flat color blocks and rhythmic structure provide an ideal visual foundation. We aim to incorporate its geometric layout to design a maze-like dynamic visual experience, where each square becomes part of a playable path.

## Part 2
Grid-based movement and pixel-style rendering using 2D arrays in p5.js. This coding technique allows us to transform Mondrian’s geometric grid into a two-dimensional array structure, where we can define “walkable areas,” “walls,” and “dynamic elements.” By listening to keyboard input, the player character can move along the paths—similar to Pac-Man—to create an interactive maze experience. Combined with colored blocks and animation logic, this approach enhances rhythmic dynamics and echoes the artistic language of Mondrian.
